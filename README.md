# projecter-for-propeller
My submission for my technical interview at Propeller Communications

The live version is available at http://todo-obax.c9users.io/propeller/public/tasks.

The solution is based on Laravel, with jQuery and Semantic UI on the front end.
Apologies for the absence of a working modal attached to the Edit button.
